About the Project
This project captures customized critical InterSystems IRIS for Health production information at runtime and will generate an email detailing the data.  The information contained in the email includes:  counts of messages in Error, Suspended, Queues, and Alerts.  Additionally, the email reports the database file sizing, folder space, and certificate expiration dates.   This email helps users identify immediate issues within a production as well as assisting with deriving trends with issue counts.
